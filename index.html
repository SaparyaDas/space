            <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was established in 1978.</h5>
            <p class="text-muted">St. Xavier Church, is a Roman Catholic Latin Rite shrine in Kottar, Nagercoil, in the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu state, India. While Francis Xavier was doing missionary work in Kottar and its neighbourhood, he averted an invasion of Vadugas with the help of the army of Paravars and Padaiyatchis of Kottar, at Vadasery, thus protecting the people of the Venad kingdom from that attack which was appreciated by the king, Unni Kerala Varma, who became closer to the priest and befriended him from then on. In recognition of Xavier’s services, the king allotted him a piece of land to construct a Catholic church, as a gesture of goodwill, as per the church records. There was already a small church, in the same place where St. Xavier’s church stands at present, dedicated to Mary the Mother of God, since AD 1544 .[2] Church records indicate that St. Xavier Church was built in 1600. In 1865, the Shrine of Mary was renovated and enlarged. In 1930, the church was raised to the status of a cathedral. The annual festival is celebrated during November – December, lasting for 10 days.</p>

        <p>Today we had our School Debate contest and I was shortlisted in the A team. The topic given was ‘Environment pollution’ and I was really excited as it is a topic close to my heart. The judges were from ABC Technical College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict to me.

            Our team started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to the debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the B team fought well, it was the A team which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text text-success col-Ig-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Accurancy
            Humans are prone to error,even if we provide them with supporting computational devices.Automated Attendence
            Management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data
            entry.This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
            <br>
            2. Ecomics
            Have you ever thought that attendence management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end
            to inaccurate time reporting,buddy punching,absenteeise,tardiness,time above,and overpayment.As a matter 
            of fact,a study done by the Axsium Group found that large oraganizations save up to $1,600 per employee After
            implementing automated atttendance management system.
            <br>
            3.Productivity/efficiency
            Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming,laborious,and expensive affair.It takes
            time to process paper sheets and time cards,create schedules,authorize leave and overtime,and create
            payroll manually.Free up precious administration time with am automated system that does it all for you,from
            keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing informating into your payroll system.The time and
            effort saved combined with data accurancy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased
            Productivity and improves profits.And many more like visibility/insights,Hassle Free workflow Management,
